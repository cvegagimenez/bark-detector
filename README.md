## Bark Detector Project

### Project Purpose
The goal of this project is to develop a system capable of detecting dog barks using an ESP32 microcontroller. The system processes audio input, identifies bark events, and can be used for monitoring environments where barking is relevant (e.g., kennels, homes, shelters).

### Current Implementation
- Audio acquisition and processing using ESP32
- Bark detection logic
- Communication features (WiFi, SNTP)

### Future Plans
We plan to extend the project by sending detected bark events and sensor data to an MQTT broker. This will allow integration with monitoring and observability platforms, enabling real-time data analysis, alerting, and visualization.

#### Planned Features:
- MQTT data publishing for bark events and sensor readings
- Integration with external monitoring/observability platforms
- Enhanced data parsing and analytics
